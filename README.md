## Hi there 👋

I'm Saif, full stack dev with more interest in front-end and design more than anything else
Started as a UI/UX Designer, flew my way through to the front-end world.

⚽ Football (Soccer for certain group of people) is what I have passion for and what I enjoy the most as stress relieve.
Made over 10 front-end projects with 2 full-stack apps and many more UI designs.

Fav Tools:
  Framer, Figma, VS Code, Netflix, Spotify...
